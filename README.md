### Compiling and autoprefixing the LESS
* Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) if it is not already installed
* Install all the required packages (only need to be done once):
  `npm install q node-watch less autoprefixer-core`
* Run the compile.js in order to start listening for changes in the LESS files:
  `node compile.js`
